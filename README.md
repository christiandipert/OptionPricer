# Visualized Option Pricer & Predictor

This repository is a journal where I explore some of the different techniques to price American & European option contracts, including:

- Black-Scholes European Model
- Bjerjsund-Stensland American Model
- Other randomization models, such as Monte-Carlo

I hope to explore some of the ways and reasons why Black-Scholes seems to almost always dominate the sphere of options pricing, and explore other methods of doing so.

I hope to apply some of the methods utilized in this presentation:
