# Visualized Option Pricer & Predictor

This repository is a journal where I explore some of the different techniques to price American & European option contracts, including:

Black-Scholes European Model
Bjerjsund-Stensland American Model,
Monte-Carlo Options Pricing Model

I hope to explore some of the ways and reasons why Black-Scholes seems to almost always dominate the sphere of options pricing, and explore other methods of doing so.

I hope to apply some of the methods utilized in this presentation:
